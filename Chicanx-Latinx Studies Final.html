            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> All right, welcome everyone. My name is Emmanuel. Today we're going to be talking a little bit more of a serious topic. We haven't really discussed too much about it ourselves in terms of like personally, but we I have taken a bit of time to learn about the subject itself. To begin, I'm being joined by Jackson.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #14e95b;"><b>Jackson:</b></mark> Hey, hows it going
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> He he knows a little bit or he actually knows quite a bit about the topic and we're kind of just. He knows a little bit or he actually knows quite a bit about the topic and we're kind of just going to be going back and forth, trying to figure out why racism and injustice in the healthcare system were really seen, what made it kind of prevalent? I know for some historical context, systemic racism has historically been perpetuated in significant health disparities with the Chicanx community, policies such as redlining and residential segregation kind of pushed these onto underserved populations, limiting their access to good quality health care and facilities, as well as services. I know from the little learning I did in this course, I did learn about the forced sterilization of some women. I think it was like in the 1980s. Don't quote me on that, but they were basically forced. The forced sterilization was pushed upon them, and they kind of just, because of the language barriers, they didn't get interpreters or anything. They were kind of just like, "Oh, this is going to happen," and they didn't know.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #14e95b;"><b>Jackson:</b></mark> You know, kind of really saying. One would really think in a place where there are close to 65 million Hispanic people, that the translators would be a bit more accessible and on hand. But I guess that's not necessarily much of a commodity, if anything. It's kind of surprising, really, when you think about it.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> No. Yeah, in all honesty, it really is. I mean, during there's a lot of policy and institutional changes during the last 50 years. I mean, the implementation of Medicaid and Medicare in the 1960s marked a pretty big point. And the movement of expanding health care, at least for lower income populations, because before this period, only people with money were really able to afford health care like this. These programs that were introduced actually helped a lot to reduce the financial barriers within the health care system. But because that being said, that wasn't necessarily. Good, I would like to say because at the end of the day they were pretty much offered lower, lower services and lower facilities, right.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #14e95b;"><b>Jackson:</b></mark> And I know a lot of it also stemmed from like a lot of like where housing kind of was situated. I think there was a study done back in 2020 or 2021 where it went into detail about how a how probably about 44 or 41% of Hispanics lived in like underserved neighborhoods where a lot of that wasn't very accessible. Which really wasn't even really a good basis to start. Plus, if they were trying to find more better conditions, it'd have to be a lot farther of a trip and a lot more expensive. And I know that may not have been as easy for most people back then. I mean, honestly, it's still now, really.

        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> Yeah, in all honesty, it kind of makes it like pretty hard to just try to get healthcare. Because even now, like from personal experience, like it's our healthcare isn't the worst. But I wouldn't like to say it's the best. Yeah, so it's it's not the best either. So I mean, we kind of have to pull some money out when we have like bigger stuff. But like for most part, like if we need surgeries or like bigger stuff, that's kind of covered. But I know with community health initiatives have been instrumental in addressing health care inequalities, the federally qualified health care or health centers. Emerged during the 1960s, which remained critical in providing affordable and cultural, culturally competent care to underserved populations, which in all honesty is a pretty good. It's a pretty big deal in my opinion, because they're really good to people of lower income. That being said though, like I said before. Depending on the facility itself, the quality of service can either be actually good or it could be pretty bad. It kind of just depends on where you go. If it's a lower income, lower income area already,
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #14e95b;"><b>Jackson:</b></mark> Then it's just more likely to end up going there and that's like level of service is just not going to be at a point where it should be. And I think that's just unfortunately like an area thing too really. It's hard to even fully say it's like a. It is a racial injustice, yes, but it also sucks because of the underserved neighborhoods already. It's just a really weird circle. That's just not ideal at all.  
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> Yeah, yeah, it's definitely not ideal. And then on top of that, with the facilities being in lower income areas, they can't get as high quality machines and like doctors so that they can test to make sure that that it is for certain.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #14e95b;"><b>Jackson:</b></mark> Right. The hospital itself on its own just won't be good as well either just cause of my head as well.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> Yeah, it if for example it wouldn't be functioning at like a full 100% because of the lower staff, the lower medical equipment and this kind of ties into like just just persistent challenge that are that are faced within this within the lower income healthcare industry.  I mean most of the time despite the advancements, significant barriers in. health equity persists, undocumented individuals are always faced down with systemic exclusion from public health care programs. And then this kind of leaves them without essential services that could be pretty much detrimental or could be beneficial for their health, which could either result in like them living a better, more healthy lifestyle, or it could result in death just because of they don't have the- 
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #14e95b;"><b>Jackson:</b></mark> The facilities or the money to be. The money to be able to be helped, like it shouldn't be a matter of, oh, you can't afford. Well, that's kind of tough, I guess. But that's unfortunately, it's kind of just how the way things are now. But it's also like when it's done so broadly over a community, it's really just a it's a really sad, sad, honestly.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> Oh yeah, no, it's definitely really sad. I mean, it kind of just because most people, when they come for lower health, lower income areas and then the health care system doesn't really assist with anything. It kind of builds resentment toward the actual system. And this kind of ties back to current events right now with the whole Healthcare United CEO getting assassinated. Yeah, I found crazy because it was out of, I wouldn't say it was out of nowhere because they were trying to like. They were trying to change the policies with anesthesia and everything. Yes, some surgeries wouldn't be completely covered or something along those lines.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #14e95b;"><b>Jackson:</b></mark> I think to my understanding what it was was Blue Cross Blue Shield specifically came out recently and it said that anesthesia after a certain amount of time, after a procedure like for an allotted amount of time, after that point insurance will no longer cover. The anesthesia. So depending on the time on like how long the procedure went on for, if it passed, however long the insurance was willing to cover for originally, whatever was paid out after would have been out of pocket. And as some people may or may not know, anesthesia costs a bit. So it's yeah, no, it's honestly it's a really interesting policy to hear people trying to roll out and I always think it's possible that stuff like this could have been like stemmed from that too really. It's like. Maybe not the same company, but people still understand that these healthcare leaders are trying to make these kind of decisions and people like, yes, decide to do whatever they please with that. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> Yeah. And then in all honesty, I mean, in my opinion, that's just kind of like the decision just came out of nowhere. And like, why would that need to happen unless you're trying to profit off? 
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #14e95b;"><b>Jackson:</b></mark>  And the people that are already in lower income, like the people who will be able to start getting anesthesia and then will have to be like charged out the wazoo for it. It's that's only gonna negatively in fact impact those lower and underserved neighborhoods more just because there's already so little in that area right now. With this tactic, they could at least leeway a little bit of coverage for anesthesia and then if they were to say, oh, but after this point in time. you're going to start paying for it more. And for all they know, they have no idea if that could even happen. It's honestly a risk that people are going to be more likely to take because the insurance companies could be a bit more open to offering out anesthesia more just to leverage this rule.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> Yeah. And then with that being said, like even like after the assassination took place, the whole Anthem Blue Cross kind of just pretty much retracted their statement and were like, yeah, no, this isn't happening. But it kind of, I feel like this, this event kind of provides an insightful lens into kind of examining the effects that the healthcare industry can and not really putting an emphasis on these systemic inequalities. It basically just kind of, 
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #14e95b;"><b>Jackson:</b></mark>  It perpetuates insanity.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> Yeah, it's kind of pushing. I don't know how to say this. It kind of provides money.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #14e95b;"><b>Jackson:</b></mark> It gives, it gives over facility services. Yeah, it gives people, it pisses people off, frankly, for one. And it gives people reason to lash out like this. Not saying that it's acceptable in any way, regardless, but I feel if there were certain choices in recent years with the recent healthcare groups like United Healthcare and Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, that frankly, this probably couldn't have, this didn't have to have happened. And I think it's when these lower, these lower income communities get impoverished and like leveraged like this, it's a hard, it's a hard thing to witness. But at the same time, it's like, OK, it's I understand why this is in place or not, not in place, but why this is happening. But it's all just a cycle. That's really all that it is.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> Yeah, it really is. But the from what I. This being said, I mean, that kind of ties back to like how there's just as they've seen within the health care system, there's just many people getting denied claims, getting pushed, pushed aside while the CEOs are profiting a pretty good amount of money from just denying these claims.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #14e95b;"><b>Jackson:</b></mark> right
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> And over the past 50 years, the healthcare industry has taken significant steps to address some of these systemic, some of the systemic racism and injustices seen. But with that being said, they still have a long ways to go before they're fully realized, I guess in terms of making sure that community driven programs and diversity is kind of seen within the healthcare system to and provide higher. Quality services to those lower income areas. That being said, however, there are also those structural barriers such as exclusions for undocumented individuals and insufficient attention to occupational health, which kind of needs to be more emphasized just for the main fact that people need to understand that just because they're, in other words, tax bracket. Doesn't necessarily mean that they require that they deserve lower services. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #14e95b;"><b>Jackson:</b></mark> And have a less of a right to live as well, yeah
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> Yeah. It's kind of just ties back to like, why is the healthcare system so focused on money rather than saving the lives of people that are in desperate need of it?
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #14e95b;"><b>Jackson:</b></mark>  Right. And I think of this at the end of the day, I feel like we all kind of know why that really is. And it's a it's kind of a simple thing, but it also kind of would also explain to why we have had these injustices and racial issues with healthcare for the last 50 years. Corporate greed. And with that folks, we've reached our time. I don't know if you want to drag us out. We we we hit our few minutes already. But thank you guys for taking a moment to listen. Again, appreciate, appreciate the words taking. I really appreciate your personal experience on this as well. And yeah, thank you for having me on as well. It was always a pleasure.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> Yeah, always a pleasure to have you. Well, with that being said, we will be wrapping up this portion of the of the podcast itself and we'll be joined shortly by another guest. All right.
        </p>

        <p> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

        <p>
            <b>This portion of the podcast is a seperate interview with a good friend and guest that sees some of these injustices within their job.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> All right, so we're back here and I'm joined by Yareni Garcia, and she'll tell you a little bit about herself and the profession she's in and how she's able to see some of these injustices seen within the healthcare system.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #973ccc;"><b>Yareni:</b></mark> Hello, my name is Yareni, just like he said. I am 20 years old and I am currently majoring in registered nursing, and I am currently finishing up my prereqs and hopefully getting into the RN program at RCC, hopefully next year. And I do work at a clinic.  It is not really... Sorry, I blinked, hold on. So I do see people from all types of ethnic backgrounds come into our clinic, and some recently do have just came from Mexico, some from Africa, some from Asia. So there is a lot of things we have to help them with, especially with their paperwork and trying to figure out how they could apply for insurances, especially if they come in sick and they have no insurance and they have to pay out of pocket, but they cannot afford it. It is very difficult since most of them do not have a social security, so it really makes the applications more difficult. And we do see within like our Latinos community, a lot of them do not have insurance, especially within the children of the families who were born here, since it is very hard for the parents to be able to fill out the paperwork, or they usually have no idea what to do. And I do see that some of them do not know how to read or write in Spanish because they do come from rural parts of Mexico. So we do have to help them out in that process.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> So quick question for you. How do you see the injustices between the language barriers and how the translation works with the paperwork itself? 
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #973ccc;"><b>Yareni:</b></mark> So a lot of these times, these patients do go to like the Medi-Cal offices. And they do tell us that they usually don't have Spanish speakers or they get lost in translation since there's many Spanish speakers who end up losing their Spanish or forgetting how to translate. And we do see this as well when they are speaking with the doctors inside the patient's rooms, when they are stating their concerns about their health, the doctors don't really understand them or some of the MAs are unable to translate fully to like what they are concerned about.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> And with that being said, how does this translate to the patient themselves and the doctor? How do they are able to get their diagnosis and their recommendations to the patient? 
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #973ccc;"><b>Yareni:</b></mark> So a lot of the times we do see that patients either call us back on the phone or come into the office and they tell us, like, I did try telling the doctor that this was my concern and he completely like changed it or he didn't fully understand what she was trying to say. And then, like, for example, if the patient's saying that their leg is hurting and then they send them to get an x-ray for their knee when the problem is stating for their leg, it's all due to the loss of translation and how. Some of the patients try to speak in English to the doctors, but they aren't able to fully understand, which is explains why a lot of our patients really do prefer when we have a Spanish speaking like PA come in or a doctor.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> And since there is such a lack of Spanish speakers, do you see, since you are a student at RCC, do you see many other students that are coming in that are of like Mexican ethnicity or like that would identify as Hispanic?
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #973ccc;"><b>Yareni:</b></mark> Yes, I do. Most of my friends in my CNA classes or in my pre-req classes, they are a majority of Mexican students. But when you do speak to them in Spanish or you try to like say something to them in Spanish, they don't really speak it as often. And it's just like how we come here and we are obligated to speak more English. That's what happens. You begin to forget your Spanish. And I do hear a lot of them say that they wish that they spoke more Spanish, especially because when you are going in the medical field, it is important to kind of have that second language, especially Spanish because Latin. Latinos are gonna be almost gonna, sorry, going to overpopulate America, especially since it is a growing population and they are coming in and we are reproducing at a high rate. So we will eventually outdo everyone, not outdo them, but we are going to overpopulate all the other ethnicities here. So it is important for us as Latinos to be able to speak Spanish to our fellow raza, as we say. That way we are able to communicate their needs and we can advocate for any of their sicknesses or what they are feeling.
        </p>

        <p>
            <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue;"><b>Emmanuel:</b></mark> All right, and I just wanted to say, good part of this kind of ties back to a little bit of what I learned going throughout one of the first modules. And that's with a lot of seeing a lot of lack of Hispanic culture or like Hispanic people within the education system. And it kind of makes it difficult when there is such a need for Hispanics or for Spanish speakers in the health care system just because it makes it so much more difficult for those Hispanic people to get that help that they need. But with that being said, I think that is a good place to wrap up this podcast. So I'd like to just say thank you for joining.
